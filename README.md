# Dashboard (Frontend)
This is frontend part of my project. This project will be a dashboard with logging/registering users. Every user can select some functionalities
or things, what he wants to show on his account.

After clonning this project, first, run **npm install** command.
If you want to push (deploy) changes to remote repositories, you have to remove **/www from .gitignore** and then you can commit and push changes.
